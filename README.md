# Airbnb-price-category

## Introduction
Welcome to the Airbnb Price Category Prediction Challenge! In this competition, hosted on Kaggle, participants are tasked with predicting the price category of Airbnb listings based on various features such as location, amenities, property type, and historical booking data.

## Dataset
The dataset provided for this competition includes the following files:

* train.csv: This file contains the training data, which includes features representing Airbnb listings along with their corresponding price categories.
* test.csv: This file contains the test data, which includes similar features for Airbnb listings, but without the labels indicating price categories.
* Additional files: Depending on the competition setup, there may be additional files providing supplementary information about the listings, such as geographical data or property descriptions.

** Here is the link of the dataset [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cisc-873-dm-f22-a4/data) , you will click on it and then download it then use it.**
I can not put it here because it is too large 😔 

## Data Exploration
Understanding the characteristics of the dataset is crucial for building effective predictive models. Some key aspects of data exploration include:

Analyzing the distribution of the target variable (price categories).
Identifying any missing values  and determining appropriate strategies for handling them.
Visualizing the data to uncover patterns and correlations.
Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is essential for extracting relevant information from the raw data. Some feature engineering techniques that may be applicable include:


Handling categorical variables through encoding techniques like one-hot encoding or target encoding.
Feature selection to identify the most informative features for predicting price categories.
Model Selection
For this multi-class classification task, participants may experiment with various machine learning algorithms and modeling techniques, including but not limited to:
```
LSTM
Conv2D
VGG16

```
Participants are encouraged to evaluate the performance of multiple models using appropriate evaluation metrics accuracy.

## Model Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the developed models, participants typically employ techniques such as cross-validation on the training data and assessing model performance on a held-out validation set. Additionally, the final model's performance is evaluated on the competition leaderboard using the provided test set.

## Results
After training and fine-tuning the models, participants can submit their predictions for evaluation on the competition platform. The results are typically scored based on predefined evaluation metrics, and participants can track their performance on the leaderboard throughout the competition duration.

## Conclusion
Participating in the Airbnb Price Category Prediction Challenge offers an opportunity to gain insights into the factors influencing Airbnb listing prices and develop models that can accurately predict price categories for new listings. By leveraging machine learning techniques and data analysis, participants can contribute to improving pricing strategies and user experiences in the Airbnb marketplace.
